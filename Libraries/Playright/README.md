# Playwright for Python

Playwright is a powerful browser automation library for Python, developed by Microsoft. It provides a high-level API to interact with browsers, allowing you to automate tasks, perform end-to-end testing, capture screenshots, generate PDFs, and more.

## Description

Playwright for Python enables you to write expressive, reliable, and maintainable browser automation scripts. It supports three major browsers: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, offering a unified API for all of them.

The key features of Playwright include:

- **Multi-Browser Support**: Write scripts that work seamlessly across different browsers without modifying your code.
- **Headless and Headful Mode**: Choose whether to run your scripts in headless mode (without a visible browser UI) or headful mode.
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple browser instances in parallel, making it efficient for large-scale testing and automation.
- **Page Interactions**: Interact with pages using high-level API methods such as `click`, `type`, `screenshot`, and more.
- **Network Interception**: Intercept and modify network requests for testing purposes.
- **Mobile Emulation**: Emulate mobile devices to test the responsiveness of your web applications.
